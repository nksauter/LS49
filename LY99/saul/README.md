Planning for the March 2022 LY99 SPREAD data collection.  Develop an entirely new workflow for SPREAD analysis building on the Sauter 2020 and Mendez 2021 papers.  Perform the following steps:
1. Simulate a 100,000-image dataset, on a Rayonix form factor, with and without a point spread function (PSF).  See [slurm script 918365](./sim_918365.sh).  I will develop the scattering factor analysis first without the PSF, and later consider the PSF.  Also, in order for shot-to-shot spectra to be associated with these simulated images, a special dxtbx.format file [must be installed](../../format). 
2. Indexing and integration with dials.stills_process, naive, with [index1_922530.sh](./index1_922530.sh) and [phil file index1.phil](./index1.phil).
3. Due to a half-pixel mismatch between simulated diffraction and metadata, the Level-0 detector position must be refined.  Steps for this are 
  a) ```dials.combine_experiments ../922530/idx-LY99_MPIbatch_000*.img_refined.expt ../922530/idx-LY99_MPIbatch_000*.img_indexed.refl reference_from_experiment.detector=0``` to combine just 30000 images, 
  b) then dials.refine [refine_level0_mcd.phil](./refine_level0_mcd.phil) combined.* output.experiments=refined_mcd.expt output.reflections=refined_mcd.refl
  c) comparison of the input and output with dials.show to determine the refined beam position.
4. Indexing and integration with dials.stills_process, using the updated detector position, with [index2_927185.sh](./index2_927185.sh) and [index2.phil](./index2.phil).
5. Unit cell analysis using a covariance model.  Output all unit cells (tdata file) with [tdata_928007.sh](./tdata_928007.sh).  Then run the covariance analysis with ```uc_metrics.dbscan file_name=928005/ly99sim_30000.tdata space_group=C12/m1 feature_vector=a,b,c eps=0.20 write_covariance=928005.tt metric=L2norm show_plot=True```, ultimately writing the covariance file covariance_ly99sim_30000.pickle.
6. A conventional merging run with Friedel mates separate, with [merge_928123.sh](./merge_928123.sh). 
7. A straight run with the [annulus worker](./annulus_929171.sh) to determine the integration shoeboxes and number of pixels available for SPREAD.
8. A series of regression tests for basic capabilities leading to global parameter refinement.
   - [test_product_0](./test_product_0_1285245.sh): The input worker is asked to keep_imagesets and read_image_headers.  Then simply test the ability of a downstream worker
    to read spectra and raw data arrays from the imageset data. The total count
    reported in the main log should agree with the number of lattices passing the unit cell filter.
    Currently FAILS on 100 nodes, presumably exceeding the on-node memory.  Logs only capture 90014 of 97878 images, 1659 of 3200 ranks.  No traceback.  We do not have to make this test work, see test 00.
   - [test_product_00](./test_product_00_1385292.sh): The input worker is asked to keep_imagesets but not read_image_headers.  Then test the ability of a downstream worker
    to read spectra and raw data arrays from a newly constructed imageset. The total count
    reported in the main log should agree with the number of lattices passing the unit cell filter.
    Currently SUCCEEDS on 100 nodes, 100K images, in under 3 minutes.
   - [test_product_1](./test_product_1_1385692.sh): The worker defines the set of shoeboxes for subsequent spread analysis, and creates a new bool array
    in the reflections table to flag these shoeboxes.  RMSD statistics are reported, both for the spread shoeboxes and for the whole set of reflections.
    This test succeeds in 2m:42s with 100 nodes/100K images.
   - [test_product_2](./test_product_2_1404150.sh): This worker demonstrates per-spot parameter refinement.
    It reads the spectrum and pixel data in the downstream worker (with per-image destruction).  It defines
    the set of shoeboxes for subsequent spread analysis.  It creates a model consisting of the DIALS
    shoebox plane fit (Rossmann) plus the whitelist monochromatic Bragg simulated in the Kokkos_gpu execution
    space.  Then it executes a per-spot planar fit to the rectangular shoebox border.  RMSD and Z-score are
    evaluated before and after.
    This test succeeds, but load balancing is an issue:

|    Workers dispatched             | 1 node/ 1 K images    |10 nodes/ 10 K images     | 100 nodes/ 100 K images  |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
|using the merge.py balance worker  | | 4m:50s, 17-49 images/rank | 7m:30s, 14-52 images/rank|
|not using the balance worker       | 3m:10s, 30-32 images/rank | 3m:40s, 28-32 images/rank | 5m:10s, 26-32 images/rank|
    This test succeeds with 10 nodes/10K images (5 min.), and 100 nodes/100K images(7.5 min).
   - [test_product_3](./test_product_3.sh): This worker demonstrates per-lattice parameter refinement.
    Shoebox plane fit is optimized, but here it is done as a single LBFGS minimization for the whole
    lattice.  A generic parameter optimizer is prototyped.
    The test succeeds with 10 nodes/10K images (5 min.).
   - [test_product_3A](./test_product_3A.sh): First demonstration of a lattice-wide optimized
    parameter, in this case the overall scale factor G. Also, this implements a polychromatic model 
    instead of a monochromatic approximation, although we still use wavelength-independent structure factors.
    There is a slight radial r.m.s.d. improvement, polychromatic (0.79 px) vs. DIALS (0.99px).
    Due to perlmutter degradation, only tested with 1 node, 1K images (4 min).
   - [test_product_3B](./test_product_3B.sh): Same G scale-factor refinement, but use the diffBragg simulator.
    Simulated shoebox pixels are closely proportional to those of nanoBragg, with C.C.>99% for most images, C.C.>97% for all.
    Radial r.m.s.d. improvement, is similar to that with nanoBragg: polychromatic (0.81 px) vs. DIALS (0.99px).
    Due to perlmutter degradation, only tested with 1 node, 1K images (19 min). The increase in wall time is
    1) evaluation of simulated pixels each iteration, not done in 3A; 2) intrinsic wall time increase due to each-cycle
    round trip in diffBragg.
   - [test_product_4](./test_product_4.sh): Refinement of G scale-factor and crystal rotation.
    Radial r.m.s.d. improvement is now polychromatic (0.72 px) vs. DIALS (0.99px).  Wall time for 4 nodes, 1K images is 100 min
    with 32 ranks.
   - [DiffBragg stage 1, roi_mini.sh](./roi_mini.sh): Refine images with diffBragg stage 1 (as a call to hopper_utils.refine).
     As implemented, it refines the G-scale factor, orientation, unit cell, and Ncells_abc.  Mosaic spread eta is fixed at the
     ground truth value (if phil flag is set to refine eta, results diverge slightly). More information about diffBragg:
     [diffBragg API FAQ](https://github.com/cctbx/cctbx_project/tree/master/simtbx/diffBragg#apifaq).
     Radial r.m.s.d. improvement here is polychromatic (0.79 px) vs. DIALS (0.99px).  Wall time for 8 nodes, 1K images is 16 min
     with 64 ranks.

10. An attempt (in progress) to perform the same refinement with the exascale_api.  In the worker spread_roi.py, comment in the call to exa1.  Then use this input script: [exa_mini.sh](./exa_mini.sh).

work in progress on exascale API:

```

Another experimental workflow:

First modify `$MODULES/LS49/LY99/saul/sim_dials_ds1.sh` to correct the hardcoded paths labeled
`FIXME`. Then start an interactive session:
```
$ salloc -N 1  -A m3890_g -t 60 -q interactive -C gpu -G 1
```
Then just source the script in an empty directory:
```
$ mkdir work
$ cd work
$ source $MODULES/LS49/LY99/saul/sim_dials_ds1.sh
```
Finally check the unit cells from DiffBragg stage 1 refinement:
```
$ grep ucell[012] out/rank_0.out
ucell0: 67.199663
ucell1: 59.799025
ucell2: 47.199492
ucell0: 67.199766
ucell1: 59.798947
ucell2: 47.199722
```
